# UI-patter-project-weather-app


Html: 
Made usre to have my CSS and HTML files connected.
Imported bootstrap, both CSS and JS links.
Imported the npm axios link as well which I found on gitHub.

Created a basic primitive layout. 
Tried to replicate or at least make a similar layout as the google weather forecast.

CSS: 
Took the exact colors of the google weather forecast (found them through the conosle).
The rest of my CSS is pretty self explandetory. 
Made mostly sure that the layout is adjusted properly. 

JS: 
First intergated (or at least tried) the API key.
Went to Open Weather Map and created an API key which didn't work. 
Took me about 11 API keys until I finally found one that worked.
Added the API key to my JS file (that was the first thing I added into my JS file).
Went into the open weather map to look up the ''current weather Data'' as they had hourly, weekly and so on. 
Integrated that into my JS.
After that added the axios link. 

My original idea was to have the city, temperature, time and date change but I only managed to make the city and temperature change. Time is still off. I assume it's beacuse of the API key. Most of the keys I tried (the ones who did work, only made halp of my code visoble for some reason???? No clue why!!!! The one I'm using now is the only one that worked fully!
I pulled the weather icons also from the Open Weather Map. 
MAde sure to diplay the changes by using the inner.html.
Wasn't able to show percipitation as I didn't find it in the console.
All in all this took me 4 full days of work. Morning till bed time.
Some of you may be quicker but for me it was no easy at all. Googled a lot and then some more!!!!
